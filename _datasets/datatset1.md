collection: datasets
permalink: /datasets/dataset1
excerpt: 'This dataset contains transcribed entries from the "Prairie Directory of North America" (Adelman and Schwartz 2013) for the Tallgrass, Mixed Grass, and Shortgrass prairie regions of the united states. We identified the historical spatial extent of the Tallgrass, Mixed Grass, and Shortgrass prairie regions using Ricketts et al. (1999), Olson et al. (2001), and Dixon et al. (2014) and selected the counties entirely or partially within these boundaries from the USDA Forest Service (2022) file. The resulting lists of counties are included as separate files. The dataset contains information on publicly accessible grasslands and prairies in these regions including acreage and amenities like hunting access, restrooms, parking, and trails.'
