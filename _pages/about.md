About
========
I am an environmental economist and PhD candidate in [Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://www.ace.illinois.edu/). I apply my skills in non-market valuation, big data, and causal inference to questions that provide decision-makers with better information so that they can make better decisions about how they manage natural resources. Iâ€™m interested in using innovative methods and datasets to improve decision making for a wide range of environments and resource uses; however, the research in my dissertation focuses on estimating the value of grassland recreation and restoration in the United States.
