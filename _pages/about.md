About
========
I am an environmental economist and PhD candidate in [Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://www.ace.illinois.edu/). I use my skills in non-market valuation, big data analysis, and causal inference to provide decision-makers with clearer, data-driven insights. These insights then enable them to make more informed and effective management decisions about natural resources. Iâ€™m interested in using innovative methods and datasets to improve decision making for a wide range of environments and resource uses; however, the research in my dissertation focuses on estimating the value of grassland recreation and restoration in the United States.

Research Interests

**Primary:** Environmental and Natural Resource Economics
