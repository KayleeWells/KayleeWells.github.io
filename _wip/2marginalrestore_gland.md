excerpt: 'Grassland, or prairie, ecosystems provide many benefits to society including species habitat, carbon sequestration, soil erosion control, and recreational opportunities. At the same time, grassland ecosystems in North America are disappearing, with grassland loss in most areas exceeding 80% since the mid-1800’s; in Illinois the loss is 99.9%. The USDA protects and restores grasslands through the Conservation Reserve Program. However, it is more costly for farmers to plant high quality grassland habitat on CRP acres, and much remains unknown about public willingness to pay (WTP) for grassland restoration projects and how that varies with grassland quality and public access to restored grasslands. This study quantifies the relationship between the value of grassland restoration and its ecological quality and public access. We use a choice experiment survey of residents in the Tallgrass Prairie region that includes area restored, ecological quality, public access with and without hunting, and annual cost to households as attributes. There were two experimental treatments in survey administration: with and without video (to see if video of the thing being valued changes respondents’ expressed preferences) and with the cost attribute expressed in terms of sales tax or income tax (to see if this affected responses from low income people who do not pay income tax.) We find that people have large MWTP for acres of grassland restored, and that the premium people are willing to pay for diverse grassland habitat is high. We also find that people have large MWTP to have walking and biking, while the average MWTP to have hunting also available is negative. Findings yield interesting insights into how preferences for open space and recreation vary among different groups of people.'
