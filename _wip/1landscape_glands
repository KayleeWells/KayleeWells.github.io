excerpt: 'Before European settlement, diverse, functioning grassland covered much of the major grassland regions in the Midwestern and Western parts of the U.S. Recent estimates suggest that nearly 80% of the historical extent of grasslands in this part of the country have been converted for agriculture and development and conversion continues today (Samson et al. 1998; Wright and Wimberly 2013; Lark et al. 2019; Berger et al. 2020). Grasslands are important for carbon sequestration, controlling soil erosion, and providing pollinator habitat (Zhao et al. 2020). USDA and other organizations know grassland restoration is valuable, but do not know how much people value their restoration at the landscape level. This research addresses this question for the Tallgrass, Mixed Grass, and Short Grass prairie regions using a nationally representative choice experiment survey of over 1,200 Americans. We focus on these prairie regions because over 76% of all acres enrolled in the USDA Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in 2022 were located there, making these regions most likely to be the focus of a similar landscape-level restoration project. In the survey, we present each respondent with six choice tasks each including a program and status quo option. Program attributes include the size of the area restored to grassland, the quality of the restored grassland, the extent of public access on the restored land, and the annual cost of the program to each respondent’s household as an increase in federal taxes. This research also addresses two methodological questions relevant to the choice experiment literature. The first relates to the inclusion of factual but politically divisive information about climate change in the survey influences willingness to pay (WTP). The second explores whether including a follow-up question intended to help identify yea-sayers provides information in addition to more commonly used follow-up questions for hypothetical bias mitigation (e.g., consequentiality questions). We contracted with IPSOS to elicit responses to the survey from their Knowledge Panel. Data collection was completed in Fall 2023. The most preferred program (with the highest level of quality and highest level of public access without hunting) produces a total value to adult Americans of about \$5.2 billion per million acres restored. This estimate more than exceeds the average cost the government incurred to enroll an additional million acres in USDA’s Conservation Reserve Program in 2022 (\$80.83 million). We also find descriptive evidence suggesting that being exposed to factual, but politically divisive, information affects WTP among people who identify as a member of a major political party but has no effect on independents.'
