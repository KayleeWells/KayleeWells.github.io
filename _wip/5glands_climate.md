excerpt: 'Grasslands, or prairies, once covered large swaths of what is now the Midwestern and Western United States. Conversion for agriculture and development has eliminated much of the native grasslands in these regions (Samson et al. 1998). What remains offers a variety of ecosystem services including recreational opportunities (Zhao et al. 2020). Grassland recreation may be particularly susceptible to the impacts of extreme heat from climate change because these sites often do not offer natural opportunities for adaptation found in similar outdoor recreation sites (e.g., shade in forests). I use mobility data to estimate a structural model of the causal relationship between short-run weather shocks and demand for recreation at 16 nationally notable grasslands. The mobility data are estimates of the number of day trips from households in nearby U.S. census block groups to each grassland for the months January 2019-April 2022. The structural model is a repeated discrete choice random utility maximization model. I specify utility for a visit to each grassland in each month as a function of a set of average daily temperature, daily precipitation, average daily wind speed, and daily snowfall bins. Using grassland, month-of-year, and hunting season fixed effects, I identify the relationship between short-run deviations from typical weather and demand for grassland recreation. Willingness to pay (WTP) per household for a grassland day trip is about \$54 on average. For reference, WTP for a day trip to a national forest in the Southern U.S. is about $130 (Sardana et al. 2016) and for a coastal fishing day trip in the Eastern U.S. is about $30 (Dundas and von Haefen 2020). I find that an additional day of extremely hot temperatures in a month would decrease average WTP for a grassland visit by about $0.60, which is comparable to estimates for coastal fishing (Dundas and von Haefen 2020). Snowfall is also a significant determinant of grassland recreation demand and responses to it and temperature differ across climates. I am incorporating climate change projections into my analysis to estimate its demand and welfare effects.'
