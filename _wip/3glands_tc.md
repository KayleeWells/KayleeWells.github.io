excerpt: 'Recreation is one of many ecosystem services grasslands provide globally (Zhao et al. 2020). In the Tallgrass Prairie Region of the United States public and private groups like USDA, U.S. Forest Service, and The Nature Conservancy are actively involved in restoring and preserving grasslands to which they provide varying degrees of public access. How much do people living in the Tallgrass Prairie Region states of Iowa, Illinois, and Minnesota value the recreational opportunities grasslands provide? I answer this question using the travel cost method. Although the literature contains related travel cost studies (e.g., Knoche et al. 2015), this is the first study to focus on grassland recreation in this region outside of the context of specific grassland species or conservation programs. Data on trip demand comes from a general population survey of adults living in the three target states. I estimate a repeated discrete choice model (Morey et al. 1993) and find that average per-trip recreational value for grasslands in the region is just under $10. I also find that people over 65 and those who identify as black are significantly more likely to choose not to recreate at a grassland than people between 18 and 24 and people who identify as white and not Hispanic.'
