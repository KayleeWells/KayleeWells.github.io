excerpt: 'We estimate the value of restoring three culturally significant sites in the Mississippi Delta using non-market valuation techniques. Known as one of the major agricultural centers in the world, the Delta also has a rich cultural history. The project was funded by the Mississippi Delta National Heritage Area whose general mission is to preserve, perpetuate, and celebrate the heritage of the Delta. The three sites are the Teoc Community, where Senator John McCainâ€™s ancestor owned a plantation, which also produced notable descendants of former slaves including Mississippi John Hurt; the Alcazar Hotel, which hosted guests such as Tennessee Williams and housed a famous radio station where Elvis Presley and B.B. King performed; and the birth house of actor and Star Wars icon James Earl Jones. The study uses both stated preference and visitation data and builds on other studies from environmental and cultural economics that have combined stated and revealed preference methods in their valuations of non-market goods.'
