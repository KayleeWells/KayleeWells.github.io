excerpt: 'Grasslands offer many important ecosystem services including recreational opportunities, but grassland recreation may be particularly sensitive to the effects of extreme heat from climate change. What impact will climate change have on grassland recreation and the well-being of the people in the U.S. heartland who uses these sites? I use mobility data to estimate a structural model of the causal relationship between short-run weather shocks and demand for recreation at 16 nationally notable grasslands. The mobility data are estimates of the number of day trips from households in nearby U.S. census block groups to each grassland for the months January 2019-April 2022. The structural model is a repeated discrete choice random utility maximization model. I specify utility for a visit to each grassland in each month as a function of average daily temperature, daily precipitation, average daily wind speed, and daily snowfall. Using grassland, month-of-year, and hunting season fixed effects, I identify the relationship between short-run deviations from typical weather and demand for grassland recreation. Willingness to pay (WTP) per household for a grassland day trip is about $54 on average. I find that an additional day of extremely hot temperatures in a month would decrease average WTP for a grassland visit by about $0.60 on average, which is comparable to estimates for coastal fishing. Snowfall is also a significant determinant of grassland recreation demand. Responses to temperature and snowfall are heterogeneous across climates. Grassland recreators in warmer climates are more responsive to temperature in general than recreators in colder climates. They also respond positively to additional days of snowfall in contrast to recreators in colder climates.'
