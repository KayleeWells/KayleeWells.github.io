title: "U.S. grassland recreation under climate change: Evidence from big visitation data and weather (Job Market Paper)"

excerpt: 'Grasslands offer a variety of ecosystem services including recreational opportunities.
Unlike forests and coastal beaches, grasslands do not offer natural opportunities for
recreators to adapt to extremely warm temperatures, potentially making grassland
recreation sensitive to climate change. I use mobility data to estimate a causal model
of the relationship between short-run weather shocks and demand for recreation at 16
nationally notable grasslands between January 2019 and April 2022. I use a repeated
discrete choice random utility maximization model and specify visit utility as a function
of a set of average temperature, precipitation, average wind speed, and snowfall
bins. I identify the causal relationship using grassland, month-of-year, and hunting
season fixed effects. Willingness to pay (WTP) per household for a grassland day visit
is about $53.60 on average - nearly twice the WTP for a coastal fishing trip in the
Eastern U.S. I find that grassland recreators are averse to visiting during months with
more extreme average temperature days, but having more days with average temperatures
slightly above extreme cold has no effect on demand. Snowfall is also a significant
demand determiner. Responses to temperature and snowfall are heterogeneous across
historical climate regions. Projections for 2081 - 2100 suggest grassland recreators are
likely to experience average annual welfare gains from climate change of up to $1.3
million from increased visit quality rather than quantity.'
